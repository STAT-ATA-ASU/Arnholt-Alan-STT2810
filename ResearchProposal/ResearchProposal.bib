	abstract = {Purpose:
Studies of adolescent smoking have concentrated on factors that are associated with smoking (vulnerability), but have tended not to examine whether these factors also describe adolescents who have been at risk of becoming smokers but have not succumbed, for example, to the social pressure of having friends who smoke (resilience).
Methods:
Results from a longitudinal study were used to examine the predictors of resilience to social influence from among a selected group of factors associated with adolescent smoking.
Results:
Among those with no recent history of smoking, the predictor variables for vulnerability and resilience were different across age. However, for adolescents who had a recent history of smoking there were no predictors of continued smoking or of stopping, apart from whether or not a friend smoked.
Conclusions:
Resilience factors against smoking show the characteristics of those who have successfully resisted the social influence to smoke. Identification of further predictors of resilience would help in the development of intervention programs and should include a reexamination of factors not usually correlated with smoking status.},

To examine the progression of tobacco use and the patterns of comorbidity of tobacco use and psychiatric disorders.
Method
The authors conducted analyses of prospective and retrospective reports, collected from 1988 to 1998, of a sample of high-and low-risk youths identified on the basis of the presence or absence of a parental history of substance abuse or dependence.
Results
A parental history of substance use disorders was associated with regular tobacco use and nicotine dependence, but not with experimentation for all youths. Individual and composite psychiatric diagnoses were strongly associated with nicotine dependence, but not with regular use or experimentation. While the presence of an affective disorder and drug abuse/dependence generally increased the risk for co-occurring nicotine dependence, analyses based on the temporal onset of disorders showed that it was the initiation of alcohol or drug use that predicted the progression to nicotine dependence. For low-risk youths, oppositional defiant disorder was the single psychiatric risk factor that predicted the transition to nicotine dependence.
Conclusions
This study adds to the accumulating evidence that has implicated comorbid psychiatric disorders in the etiology and subsequent course of nicotine dependence. In addition, family history may represent an important indicator of an increased risk for nicotine dependence.},

	issn = {1389-4986},
	abstract = {If multiple etiologies of substance use are truly at work in the population, then further strides in the accurate prediction of smoking and the use of other substances will likely be built on diverse pattern-centered approaches that explore the presence of multiple population subgroups across various substance use stages. The present study aimed to identify population subgroups defined by individual risk factors or risk factor constellations that prospectively predict specific smoking stages. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), analyses were conducted on the sample that took part in the baseline and 1 year follow-up assessment between 1994 and 1996. Classification and regression tree procedures were used to investigate the structure of individual risk factors, or constellations of risk, that define population subgroups with high rates of both experimental and established smoking. For each level of smoking, a relatively simple model including two subgroups predicted over half of the smoking cases. Findings also indicated that the two group models identified higher rates of regular smokers compared to experimental smokers. Deviant behaviors and alcohol use without permission independently predicted movement to experimentation at follow-up. Progression to regular smoking from both a nonsmoking and experimental smoking status at baseline were each predicted by smoking friends. Additionally, baseline levels of experimental use predicted movement from experimental to regular smoking, while a relatively low grade point average predicted rapid progression from baseline nonuse to regular use at follow-up. By identifying first approximations of patterns, these analyses may lead to clues regarding the major multiple mechanisms at work for the progression of smoking among adolescents.},

	abstract = {Rates of nicotine dependence vary in different sociodemographic groups in the population. These group differences remain to be understood. The objective of this study is to specify the relationship between cigarette consumption and nicotine dependence and whether group differences are explained by quantity smoked or differential sensitivity to nicotine. The data used derived from National Household Surveys on Drug Abuse (1991-1993), multistage area probability samples of the {US} population 12 years old and over, and anonymous structured household interviews, considering subjects who were last-month smokers (12,550 White, 4903 Black, 4839 Hispanic). The main outcome measure was last-year nicotine dependence based on symptoms of dependence and drug-related problems approximating {DSM}-{IV} dependence criteria. Rates are higher among females than males, Whites than minorities and the lowest among older adults. Dependence rates increase sharply up to half a pack of cigarettes smoked per day. At higher quantities, the increased risk for dependence is minimal. The higher rate of dependence among females than males results from a greater number of symptoms at the same quantity smoked. The similarity of adolescent and middle-adult rates results from the fact that adolescents smoke significantly fewer cigarettes than adults, but experience higher rates of dependence at the same levels of use. Although adults 50 and over are the heaviest smokers, they experience the lowest rates of dependence because of hypothesized lower sensitivity to increased quantity of nicotine intake. The higher rates among Whites than Blacks appear to result from heavier smoking and greater sensitivity to nicotine effects. It was concluded that adolescents, women and Whites are particularly vulnerable to becoming dependent on nicotine. Group-specific thresholds may be more appropriate criteria than an absolute threshold to define the risk for nicotine dependence.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Epidemiologic studies have reported an association between major depression and smoking. This prospective study examines the role of depression in smoking progression and cessation, and the role of smoking in first-onset major depression.
{METHODS}: Data are from a 5-year longitudinal epidemiologic study of 1007 young adults. Incidence and odds ratios ({ORs}) are based on the prospective data. Hazards ratios are based on the combined lifetime data and estimated in Cox proportional hazards models with time-dependent covariates.
{RESULTS}: Based on the prospective data, history of major depression at baseline increased significantly the risk for progression to daily smoking ({OR}, 3.0; 95\% confidence interval, 1.1-8.2), but did not decrease significantly smokers' rate of quitting ({OR}, 0.8; 95\% confidence interval, 0.4-1.6). History of daily smoking at baseline increased significantly the risk for major depression ({OR}, 1.9; 95\% confidence interval, 1.1-3.4). These estimates were reduced somewhat when history of early (ie, before age 15 years) conduct problems was controlled. Estimates based on lifetime data were consistent with these results.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The observed influences from major depression to subsequent daily smoking and smoking to major depression support the plausibility of shared etiologies. Separate causal mechanisms in each direction might also operate, including self-medication of depressed mood as a factor in smoking progression and neuropharmacologic effects of nicotine and other smoke substances on neurotransmitter systems linked to depression.},

	abstract = {The aims of this study were to examine associations between smoking initiation (five cigarettes lifetime) and lifetime psychopathology, regular smoking by family members, and psychopathology in family members; to describe the degree to which the onset of the disorder precedes or follows smoking initiation; and to examine whether smoking initiators differ as a function of age of smoking onset. Nine hundred and forty-one participants were interviewed at three time points, beginning in high school and most recently at age 24. Lifetime psychiatric diagnoses were obtained at each assessment, as were data regarding smoking initiation. Biological parents and full siblings were interviewed for lifetime psychopathology and regular smoking. Most measures of lifetime psychopathology were associated with smoking initiation. Rates of initiation were especially elevated in participants with multiple disorders. Regular smoking by mother and a sibling (but not father) was associated significantly with smoking initiation, as were two of four measures of psychopathology in relatives. When all significant univariate variables were examined in a single model, drug use disorders, regular smoking by mother, and regular smoking by a sibling remained significantly associated with smoking initiation. Smoking initiation preceded approximately half of the examined diagnostic categories. Eleven variables differentiated early vs. late smoking initiators. Several interactions with gender were found. In every instance, smoking initiation was more strongly associated with the risk factor for young women than for young men. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the relations of psychopathology and familial factors with smoking initiation have been examined simultaneously or in this much detail. Results underscore the potential importance of assessing and treating psychiatric disorders in smoking prevention and cessation efforts.},

Lifetime psychiatric diagnoses were obtained at each assessment. Biological parents and full siblings were interviewed for lifetime psychopathology and regular smoking. Progression to daily smoking was associated with lower parental education, major depression, alcohol and drug use disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) or disruptive behavior disorders, antisocial personality disorder symptoms, regular smoking by father (but not mother or sibling), and one measure of psychopathology in family members (externalizing disorders, which consisted of {ADHD}, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and antisocial personality disorder). When composite measures of internalizing disorders, externalizing disorders, familial smoking, and familial psychopathology were examined in a single model, only the externalizing disorders composite remained associated with both daily smoking and nicotine dependence. Only {ADHD} consistently preceded the onset of daily smoking. Nicotine dependence was associated with drug use disorders and alcohol use disorders. In conclusion, externalizing disorders had the strongest associations, both with progression to daily smoking among adolescents who initiate smoking and with nicotine dependence among the daily smokers.

{METHODS}: kappa and intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated for the {AUDADIS}-{IV} modules using a test-retest design among a total of 2657 respondents, in subsets of approximately 400, randomly drawn from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions ({NESARC}).
{RESULTS}: reliabilities for alcohol consumption, tobacco use and family history of major depression measures were good to excellent, while reliabilities for selected {DSM}-{IV} axis I and {II} disorders were fair to good.
